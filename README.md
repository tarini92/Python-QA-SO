## Exploratory Questions for Course Design
-> Descriptive Topics (will require active teaching by the Professor):
- Most enquired errors/topics/questions

-> Interactive Topics (more inclined towards interactive class session):
- Most comments on posts
- Most voted questions/answers

-> TAs selection:
- Most popular owner id

-> Difficulty of a question:
- Response rate for each tag/question

-> Performance of a student
- List of bad(marked) answers 

-> Topics to be covered together
- Multiple tags association

## Techniques to be explored
- Latent Semantic Analysis (identify related questions)
- Basket Analysis (tags association)
- KNN (Tags/Questions clustering)
