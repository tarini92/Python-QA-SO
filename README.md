-> TAs selection:
- Most popular owner id

-> Difficulty of a question:
- Response rate for each tag/question

-> Performance of a student
- List of bad(marked) answers 

-> Topics to be covered together
- Multiple tags association

## Techniques to be explored
- Topic Modeling
- LDA
- KNN (Tags/Questions clustering)
